        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>We dream of a world where no one goes to bed hungry. Here's how we plan to make it happen:</p>

        <p><strong>1. Build a Strong Food Sharing Network:</strong> We aim to connect restaurants, hotels, grocery stores, and households so that surplus food reaches those who need it mostâ€”never the trash.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Create a Digital Platform for Easy Access:</strong> We're building a mobile app and website where anyone can donate food, request help, and track deliveries in just a few clicks.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Educate & Inspire for Zero Hunger:</strong> We'll spread awareness in schools, colleges, and communities about reducing food waste and sharing resources to fight hunger together.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4. Use Smart Technology for Impact:</strong> Our future includes AI for predicting food demand and smart storage solutions to keep food fresh longer, ensuring maximum reach and minimum waste.</p>
        
        <p><strong>5. Build Partnerships & Grow Volunteers:</strong> We'll work with governments, NGOs, and local businesses while building a strong volunteer network to deliver food with care and dignity.</p>
        
        <p>Together, we can create a world where sharing food is as natural as sharing a smile, and where technology serves humanity's most basic needs.</p>
